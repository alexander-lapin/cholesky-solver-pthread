This program is multi-thread solver for symmetric linear systems. Can be used to obtain answer and residual.
It's based on block Cholesky decomposition. Uses pthread library.

To accelerate program it was made some features:
1. block format of matrix to maximize cache using.
Thus the matrix
a11 a12 ... a1n
a21 a22 ... a2n
...
an1 an2 ... ann

represents as block matrix
A11 A12 ... A1m
A21 A22 ... A2m
...
Am1 Am2 ... Amm
where each block Aij is matrix with (block_size, block_size) sizes.
Some docs about block algorithm can be found in folder 'doc'.

2. unrolled loops by 8 elements.

The matrix can be generated or read from file. Right hand side is generated automatic by generating answer and then multiplying matrix by answer vector.

Using:
1. Makefile in src directory
2. ./a (matrix_size) (block_size) [matrix input file]
